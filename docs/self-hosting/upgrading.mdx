Apply database migrations by running **one of** the following commands:

In a development environment, run:

```
bun --filter @calcom/prisma run db-migrate
```

(this can clear your development database in some cases)

In a production environment, run:

```
bun --filter @calcom/prisma run db-deploy
```

Check for `.env` variables changes

```
bun run predev
```

Start the server. In a development environment, just do:

```
bun run dev
```

For a production build, run for example:

```
bun run build
bun run start
```

Enjoy the new version.
